# 🔄 NEAR Intent Swap

**NEAR Intent Swap** is a decentralized, intent-based crypto swap protocol that empowers users to seamlessly convert **NEAR to Zcash** and other supported cryptocurrencies through secure, permissionless interactions. Unlike traditional DEXes, this protocol is powered by **user-defined intents**—describing *what* they want to achieve—while allowing relayers or liquidity bots to determine *how* to fulfill them optimally.

Alongside intent fulfillment, the protocol allows **depositing NEAR and other tokens** into the vault, enabling liquidity providers to earn rewards and support the swap ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Intent-based architecture** – Secure, expressive swap requests with flexible fulfillment logic
- 🔄 **Swap NEAR to Zcash** (ZEC) and other supported assets
- 🧩 **Multi-token support** with dynamic pair resolution
- 🔐 **Vault deposit system** – Provide liquidity to support intents and earn incentives
- ⚡ **On-chain settlement** – Fast and reliable execution directly on the NEAR blockchain
- 🌉 **Cross-chain bridge integration** – Enables delivery of Zcash and other assets across chains
- 📊 **Transparent architecture** – Every action traceable on-chain

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Users create swap intents** specifying the source token (e.g., NEAR), target token (e.g., ZEC), and minimum acceptable amount.
2. **Liquidity providers deposit** assets into the contract or bridge-enabled vaults to enable fulfillment.
3. **Relayers or bots monitor intents**, execute swaps using on-chain or bridged liquidity, and fulfill requests by sending the target asset to the user.
4. **Smart contracts handle validation, slippage checks, and fee deduction** to ensure security and fairness.

## 🔧 Deposit Example

Users can deposit NEAR or supported tokens into the vault to support swap execution and earn a share of network fees.

```bash
near call your-swap-contract.testnet deposit '{}' --accountId your-account.testnet --amount 10
```

This action adds 10 NEAR to the vault under your account.

---

## 🔄 Swap Example

To request a swap of NEAR to Zcash using an intent:

```bash
near call your-swap-contract.testnet swap '{"target_token": "ZEC", "min_amount": "1.0"}' --accountId your-account.testnet --amount 5
```

This will trigger a 5 NEAR → ZEC swap intent, which relayers can fulfill once matched.

## 🔐 Security & Design Philosophy

- 🧾 **Intent validation** ensures swap parameters are met and protected against slippage or partial fills.
- 🧠 **Relayer decentralization**: Any third party can fulfill intents, removing the need for trusted intermediaries.
- ⛓ **Full on-chain transparency**: All deposits, swaps, and relayer activity are recorded and auditable.
- 🛡 **Optional permission layers** can be added for enterprise use cases or KYC-regulated environments.

## 🛠 Future Work

> The following upgrades represent cutting-edge additions that elevate the swap into a next-gen DeFi primitive.

- 🧠 **Intent Aggregator Layer**  
  Aggregate swap intents across multiple blockchains and protocols, routing them dynamically for the most efficient fulfillment with oracle-integrated pricing.

- 🤖 **Autonomous Liquidity Bots (ALBs)**  
  Deploy AI-driven bots that manage liquidity positions, execute swaps, and rebalance funds in real-time, acting as self-optimizing market makers.

- 📡 **Off-chain Intent Broadcasting Network**  
  Develop a decentralized layer for users to broadcast signed swap intents off-chain (IPFS/Libp2p), enabling private, gasless matchmaking by relayers.

- 🧬 **Composable Swap Intents**  
  Allow users to chain multiple intents into a single atomic transaction: e.g., `NEAR → USDT → BTC → ZEC`, with fallback logic and fee prediction.

- 🧩 **Plug-and-Play SDK & REST API**  
  Provide developers with lightweight tools to plug the intent swap protocol into wallets, dApps, and mobile applications with minimal integration effort.

- 🌐 **Universal Settlement Engine**  
  Introduce abstracted final settlement layers to deliver tokens on other chains (e.g., receive ZEC on mainnet from a NEAR-originated intent) using bridges and relayers.

- 🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Intent Privacy**  
  Integrate zk-proofs to hide intent parameters (e.g., sender, amount, asset type) from the public mempool while allowing verifiable, trustless execution.
